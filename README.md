# Road segmentation
### Project 2 of the Machine Learning course at EPFL, Fall 2017.

*Magnus Lysholm Lian, Jørgen Frost Bø, Raul Villalba Felix*

##External libraries

We have used two external libraries for this project:

- Keras 2.0.8, [installation.](https://keras.io/#installation)
- TensorFlow 1.2.1, [installation.](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

Keras uses TensorFlow as backend. Please be certain that both of these libraries are installed before running any code.

##Run

To save time to create the prediction file, we have already trained the model and saved the weights.
To get the prediction file, please run the 'run.py'.
Keep in mind that you will have to provide a valid datapath for the training and test data to be able to run the file.

##Train

We have provided the file 'train_model.py' for those who wish to run the model from the ground.
This will however take some time, depending on the computer setup. We used approximately 40 hours.
